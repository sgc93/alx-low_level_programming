<h1>Low Level Programming  with C </h1>
<b> C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a low-level language that allows for direct manipulation of computer memory, making it useful for system programming, embedded systems, and other applications where direct hardware access is necessary.
</b>

C is a versatile programming language that can be used to develop a wide range of software applications, including:-
<ul>
   <li> <b> Operating systems:</b> Many operating systems, including Unix, Linux, and Windows, are written in C.</li>
   <li> <b> System programming:</b> C is well-suited for developing system-level programs, such as device drivers, network protocols, and file systems.</li>
   <li> <b> Embedded systems:</b> C is commonly used in the development of embedded systems, such as microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and other specialized hardware.</li>
   <li> <b> Game development:</b> Many game engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, offer C as a programming language option for game developers.</li>
   <li> <b>Desktop applications:</b> C can be used to create desktop applications, such as text editors, media players, and image editors.</li>
   <li> <b>Web development:</b> While not as popular as other languages such as JavaScript or Python, C can be used to develop web applications through frameworks like CGI (Common Gateway Interface) or FastCGI.</li>
   <li> <b>Artificial intelligence and machine learning: </b>C can be used in the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms and libraries, such as TensorFlow and OpenCV.</li>
   <li> <b>Security software:</b> C is a common language for developing security software, such as antivirus programs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.</li>
 </ul>
